# API Key

<p>API Keys are free, and highly recommended. They increase your rate limits, and seriously decrease the chances your server will be blacklisted if we have a problem with something you're doing. Make sure to provide valid contact information, else your key WILL be disabled.</p>
<p>To get a key, join [this server](https://yiff.rest/support) and run the command `/apikey create` in any channel. The response will only be shown to you. You can have up to 3 keys at a time. If your usage of the api goes beyond our current rate limit restrictions, please contact a developer.</p>
